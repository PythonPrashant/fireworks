or, clone this in your local engine with `https://github.com/SwiftyProgrammer690/fireworks.git`!

Now that you have the necessary files to work with this project, let's see what it does!

# Using it! ⚒⚒⚒

First at the beginning of your new python file, add `from src.source import *` to load the files for the package!
For now, it only has two main capabilities, but you can make it better because, after all, this is an open source project!

| Name  | What it does |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `get_org_repositories(org)`  | Get an organizations repos  |
| `get_user_repositories(user)`  | Get an users repos  |
